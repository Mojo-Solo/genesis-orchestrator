# PRD: AI Dashboard

## Executive Summary

Create a comprehensive real-time monitoring dashboard for AI systems that provides performance metrics, alerts, and operational insights. This dashboard will serve as the central command center for monitoring AI model performance, resource utilization, and system health across the Genesis Creator ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Currently, there's no unified way to monitor the performance and health of AI agents and models in our Genesis Creator system. Developers and operators lack visibility into:
- Model response times and quality metrics
- Resource consumption patterns
- Error rates and failure modes
- Agent coordination efficiency
- System bottlenecks and performance degradation

### Why is this important now?
As our AI system scales with multiple agents working in parallel, we need proactive monitoring to:
- Prevent performance degradation before it impacts users
- Optimize resource allocation across agents
- Identify and resolve issues quickly
- Ensure reliable service delivery
- Support data-driven decision making for system improvements

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**1. DevOps Engineer (Primary)**
- Needs to monitor system health 24/7
- Requires immediate alerts for critical issues
- Wants to optimize resource allocation
- Needs to troubleshoot performance problems quickly

**2. Development Team Lead (Secondary)**
- Needs to understand agent performance patterns
- Wants to identify optimization opportunities
- Requires reporting for stakeholder updates
- Needs to plan capacity and scaling decisions

**3. AI System Administrator (Secondary)**
- Needs to monitor model accuracy and drift
- Wants to track usage patterns across agents
- Requires audit trails for compliance
- Needs to manage model deployments

### Detailed User Journeys

**Journey 1: Real-time Monitoring**
1. User opens dashboard and sees system overview
2. Monitors real-time metrics for all active agents
3. Receives alert for performance degradation
4. Drills down to specific agent or component
5. Identifies root cause and takes corrective action

**Journey 2: Performance Analysis**
1. User accesses historical performance data
2. Compares metrics across different time periods
3. Identifies trends and patterns
4. Generates reports for optimization planning
5. Implements improvements based on insights

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
- Real-time metric visualization for all AI agents
- Performance dashboards with customizable views
- Alert system with configurable thresholds
- Historical data analysis and trending
- Agent health status monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking

**User Interactions:**
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis
- Alert acknowledgment and management
- Report generation and export
- Dashboard customization and personalization

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Expectations:**
- Dashboard load time < 2 seconds
- Real-time data updates every 5 seconds
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime availability

**Security Considerations:**
- Role-based access control
- Secure API authentication
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Audit logging for all user actions

**Scalability Needs:**
- Handle metrics from 1000+ AI agents
- Store 1 year of historical data
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- Reduce mean time to detection (MTTD) of issues by 80%
- Achieve 99.9% dashboard availability
- Enable monitoring of 100% of AI agents in the system
- Provide sub-second response times for metric queries
- Reduce troubleshooting time by 60%

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Dashboard response time (< 2 seconds)
- Alert accuracy rate (> 95%)
- User adoption rate (> 90% of target users)
- System uptime (99.9%)
- Time to resolution for detected issues

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must integrate with existing Genesis Creator architecture
- Limited to current technology stack (Python, Laravel, React)
- Must work within existing infrastructure budget
- Cannot impact performance of monitored systems

### Timeline Constraints
- Must be delivered within 6 weeks
- Alpha version needed in 3 weeks for testing
- Beta version with core features in 5 weeks

### Resource Limitations
- Development team of 3 engineers
- Shared infrastructure resources
- Limited budget for new third-party services

## Out of Scope

### What we're explicitly NOT building
- Custom alerting infrastructure (will use existing tools)
- Advanced AI model training capabilities
- Custom data storage solutions (will use existing databases)
- Mobile applications (web-first approach)
- Advanced analytics and machine learning features
- Integration with external monitoring tools beyond standard APIs

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Genesis Creator system must provide metrics API
- Existing monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Authentication system integration
- Database infrastructure for historical storage

### Internal Team Dependencies
- Backend team for metrics API development
- DevOps team for infrastructure setup
- Frontend team for dashboard UI development
- QA team for testing and validation

### Technology Dependencies
- Real-time data streaming capabilities
- Time-series database for metrics storage
- WebSocket support for live updates
- Chart/visualization library integration

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach
- Use WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Implement responsive design for various screen sizes
- Leverage existing component library for consistency
- Use time-series database for efficient metric storage

### Integration Points
- Genesis Creator metrics collection
- Existing user authentication system
- Current alerting infrastructure
- Monitoring and logging systems
