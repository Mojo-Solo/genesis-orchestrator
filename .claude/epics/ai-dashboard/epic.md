# Epic: AI Dashboard Implementation

## Technical Overview

This epic implements a comprehensive real-time monitoring dashboard for the Genesis Creator AI system, providing operational visibility, performance metrics, and proactive alerting capabilities.

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Next.js 15 (leveraging existing components)
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 API with real-time WebSocket support
- **Database**: Time-series data store (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Visualization**: Chart.js or D3.js for interactive dashboards
- **State Management**: Zustand for real-time state updates

### Integration Points
- **Genesis Creator Metrics API**: Collect agent performance data
- **Existing Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum integration
- **Current Infrastructure**: Leverage existing Laravel 12 backend
- **Component Library**: Use existing shadcn/ui components

## Technical Approach

### 1. Data Collection Layer
- Implement metrics collection service in Genesis Creator
- Create standardized metrics schema for AI agents
- Set up time-series database for efficient storage
- Design data retention and archival policies

### 2. API Layer
- Build RESTful endpoints for dashboard data
- Implement WebSocket server for real-time updates
- Create GraphQL subscriptions for live metrics
- Add authentication and authorization middleware

### 3. Frontend Dashboard
- Design responsive dashboard layout
- Implement real-time chart components
- Create customizable widget system
- Build alert management interface

### 4. Alerting System
- Design threshold-based alert rules
- Implement notification delivery system
- Create alert acknowledgment workflow
- Build alert history and analytics

## Task Breakdown Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Task 1.1: Metrics Collection Infrastructure**
- Design metrics schema and data model
- Implement collection service in Genesis Creator
- Set up time-series database
- Create data ingestion pipeline

**Task 1.2: Backend API Development**
- Create Laravel API endpoints for dashboard data
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Set up WebSocket server for real-time data
- Build metrics aggregation services

**Task 1.3: Database Schema Design**
- Design time-series database schema
- Create data retention policies
- Implement data archival strategies
- Set up database indexing for performance

### Phase 2: Core Dashboard (Week 3-4)
**Task 2.1: Frontend Architecture Setup**
- Set up Next.js dashboard application
- Configure WebSocket client connections
- Implement authentication integration
- Create base layout and navigation

**Task 2.2: Real-time Visualization Components**
- Build chart components for metrics display
- Implement real-time data binding
- Create interactive dashboard widgets
- Design responsive layout system

**Task 2.3: Dashboard Core Features**
- Implement system overview dashboard
- Create agent-specific monitoring views
- Build performance metrics displays
- Add historical data visualization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
**Task 3.1: Alerting System**
- Design alert rule configuration interface
- Implement threshold monitoring
- Create notification delivery system
- Build alert management dashboard

**Task 3.2: Analytics and Reporting**
- Implement trend analysis features
- Create performance reporting tools
- Build data export capabilities
- Add comparative analytics

**Task 3.3: Testing and Optimization**
- Comprehensive testing of all features
- Performance optimization and tuning
- Security audit and hardening
- Documentation and user guides

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### External Dependencies
- Time-series database deployment
- WebSocket infrastructure setup
- Monitoring data collection integration
- Authentication system connection

### Internal Dependencies
- Genesis Creator metrics API completion
- Laravel 12 backend WebSocket support
- Frontend component library updates
- Database infrastructure provisioning

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Dashboard load time < 2 seconds
- Real-time update latency < 100ms
- Support for 1000+ concurrent metrics
- 99.9% system availability

### Business Metrics
- 90% user adoption within 2 weeks
- 80% reduction in issue detection time
- 60% reduction in troubleshooting time
- 95% alert accuracy rate

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Real-time performance at scale**: Mitigation through load testing and optimization
- **Data consistency across distributed agents**: Implement eventual consistency patterns
- **WebSocket connection stability**: Add reconnection logic and fallback mechanisms

### Medium Risk
- **Time-series database selection**: Evaluate options early and prototype
- **Alert noise and false positives**: Implement smart threshold algorithms
- **Dashboard responsiveness**: Optimize rendering and data loading

### Low Risk
- **Integration with existing auth**: Well-established patterns available
- **Component reusability**: Existing component library provides foundation
- **Basic CRUD operations**: Standard Laravel patterns apply

## Definition of Done
