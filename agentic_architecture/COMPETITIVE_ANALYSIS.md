# Competitive Analysis: Agentic Architecture Systems for Knowledge Extraction and Onboarding

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive market research, this analysis examines the competitive landscape for AI-based internal knowledge capture and onboarding products, with special focus on agentic architectures built on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LAG (Latent Action Graphs), and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graphs) patterns.

### Key Findings

1. **Market Gap**: Most existing solutions focus on single-domain approaches (either pure RAG or workflow automation) rather than integrated agentic architectures
2. **Technology Shift**: Enterprises are moving from traditional RAG to agent-based architectures for better security and performance
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Our integrated RAG+LAG+DAG approach with the Brain Extractor represents a unique positioning in the market
4. **Market Opportunity**: $2.3B+ addressable market with 40%+ annual growth in AI-powered knowledge management
