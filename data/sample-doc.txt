# GENESIS Creator Meta-Agent System

The GENESIS Creator is a dynamic sub-agent creation system designed for automated development tasks. It analyzes user requests and spawns appropriate sub-agents to handle complex workflows.

## Key Features

- Dynamic sub-agent spawning based on task analysis
- Integration with CCPM project management system
- Support for multiple programming languages and frameworks
- Automated code generation and testing

## Sub-Agent Types

1. **Code Generator Agent**: Creates code files based on specifications
2. **Test Runner Agent**: Executes tests and analyzes results
3. **Documentation Agent**: Generates and maintains documentation
4. **Deployment Agent**: Handles deployment and infrastructure tasks

The system follows a meta-agent pattern where the main GENESIS Creator acts as an orchestrator, delegating specific tasks to specialized sub-agents for optimal performance and maintainability.
