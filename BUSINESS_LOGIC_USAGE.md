# Extracted WeExit Business Logic

## What You Got (CODE ONLY - No WeExit Content)

### ðŸ§  Core Algorithms
- **AssessmentScoring.php** - Three-dimensional readiness scoring
- **ExitPredictor.php** - Exit success prediction models  
- **CostTracker.php** - AI model cost optimization
- **AssessmentController.php** - Generic API controller

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
1. **Readiness Scoring Algorithm** - Calculates personal, financial, business readiness
2. **Exit Success Prediction** - Predicts probability of successful exit
3. **Valuation Impact Modeling** - How readiness affects business value
4. **Cost Optimization** - Choose optimal AI models for your use case

## How to Use in Your Project

### 1. Register Services in `config/app.php`:
```php
'providers' => [
    // Your existing providers...
    App\Services\ExitPlanning\AssessmentScoring::class,
    App\Services\ExitPlanning\ExitPredictor::class,
]
```

### 2. Add Routes:
```php
// In your routes/api.php
Route::post('/assessments/score', [AssessmentController::class, 'calculateScore']);
Route::post('/assessments/predict', [AssessmentController::class, 'predictSuccess']);
```

### 3. Use the Logic:
```php
// In any controller or service
$scoring = app(AssessmentScoring::class);
$result = $scoring->calculateReadinessScore(0.7, 0.8, 0.6);

$predictor = app(ExitPredictor::class);
$prediction = $predictor->predictExitSuccess([
    'readiness_score' => 0.7,
    'market_conditions' => 0.6,
    'value_drivers' => 0.8
]);
```

### 4. Customize for Your Use Case:
- Change variable names and terminology
- Adjust scoring weights and algorithms
- Add your own business rules
- Integrate with your data models

## This is PURE BUSINESS LOGIC
- No WeExit branding or content
- No database dependencies  
- No specific domain knowledge
- Ready to adapt to YOUR business needs

You can now repurpose these algorithms for:
- Business valuations
- Investment readiness
- Risk assessments
