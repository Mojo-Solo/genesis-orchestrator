Feature: LAG (Logic-Aware Generation) Decomposition
  As a GENESIS orchestrator user
  I want the system to decompose complex questions using LAG methodology
  So that multi-hop reasoning tasks are solved accurately and efficiently

  Background:
    Given the GENESIS orchestrator is initialized
    And the LAG decomposition engine is configured
    And the cognitive load threshold is set to "0.7"
    And the maximum decomposition depth is set to "5"

  @lag @decomposition @critical
  Scenario: Complex multi-hop question decomposition
    Given I have a complex multi-hop question "What is the population of the capital city of the country where the 2024 Olympics were held?"
    When I submit the question to the LAG decomposition engine
    Then the system should compute cognitive load CL(q) greater than threshold
    And the question should be decomposed into logical sub-questions
    And the decomposition should include the sub-question "Where were the 2024 Olympics held?"
    And the decomposition should include the sub-question "What is the capital city of [country from step 1]?"
    And the decomposition should include the sub-question "What is the population of [capital city from step 2]?"
    And the sub-questions should be ordered by dependency
    And the preflight plan should be generated with exact step order
    And no terminator should be triggered during decomposition

  @lag @ordering @dependency
  Scenario: Logical dependency ordering
    Given I have a question requiring ordered resolution "What company did the founder of Tesla's previous company work for before starting SpaceX?"
    When the LAG engine decomposes the question
    Then the first step should identify "Who is the founder of Tesla?"
    And the second step should depend on the first and ask "What was [founder]'s previous company before Tesla?"
    And the third step should depend on the second and ask "What company did [founder] work for before starting [previous company]?"
    And each step should reference prior answers in its context
    And the dependency chain should be preserved in the execution trace

  @lag @terminator @critical
  Scenario: Logical terminator activation for unanswerable questions
    Given I have an impossible question "What is the exact number of thoughts a specific person had on January 1, 2020?"
    When I submit the question to the LAG decomposition engine
    And the system begins processing the sub-questions
    Then the Critic should detect the question as "UNANSWERABLE"
    And the logical terminator should be triggered
    And processing should halt within 3 steps
    And the terminator reason should be logged in the execution trace
    And no hallucinated answer should be provided

  @lag @terminator @contradiction
  Scenario: Logical terminator for contradictory information
    Given I have a question with contradictory premises "What is the height of the tallest building that is also the shortest building in New York?"
    When the LAG engine processes the question
    Then the Critic should detect a "CONTRADICTION" 
    And the logical terminator should fire
    And the contradiction should be explained in the terminator reason
    And processing should stop before generating a false answer

  @lag @terminator @low-support
  Scenario: Logical terminator for insufficient information
    Given I have a question with insufficient retrievable information "What did John Smith think about quantum physics on March 15, 2023?"
    When the Retriever attempts to find supporting documents
    And the Critic evaluates the retrieval confidence
    Then the Critic should flag "LOW_SUPPORT"
    And the logical terminator should activate
    And the system should report insufficient information rather than guessing

  @lag @accuracy @oracle
  Scenario: LAG accuracy verification against oracle
    Given I have a verifiable multi-hop question "What is the area of the largest country in the continent where Mount Everest is located?"
    And I have the oracle answer "17,098,242 square kilometers (Russia, Asia)"
    When I process the question through LAG decomposition
    And the system completes all steps without termination
    Then the final answer should match the oracle within acceptable tolerance
    And the reasoning chain should be logically sound
    And each step should have proper citations

  @lag @performance @efficiency
  Scenario: LAG vs traditional RAG performance comparison
    Given I have a benchmark set of 10 complex multi-hop questions
    And I have baseline RAG system results for comparison
    When I process all questions through LAG decomposition
    Then LAG accuracy should be higher than RAG baseline
    And the reasoning transparency should be superior
    And the average confidence score should be higher
    And the citation quality should be improved

  @lag @memory @context
  Scenario: Prior answers conditioning later retrieval
    Given I have a question "What is the GDP of the country that won the most medals in the 2020 Olympics?"
    When the LAG engine processes step 1 "Which country won the most medals in 2020 Olympics?"
    And retrieves the answer "United States with 113 total medals"
    Then step 2 should use "United States" as context for retrieval
    And the Retriever should search for "United States GDP" specifically
    And the context from step 1 should be preserved in memory
    And subsequent steps should build upon prior answers

  @lag @circuit-breaker @safety
  Scenario: Circuit breaker activation for runaway decomposition
    Given the maximum steps limit is set to "10"
    And the maximum time limit is set to "300 seconds"
    When I submit a question that could lead to infinite decomposition
    Then the circuit breaker should activate before exceeding limits
    And processing should halt gracefully
    And a partial result with explanation should be provided
    And the termination reason should be logged

  @lag @artifacts @traceability
  Scenario: Complete LAG artifacts generation
    Given I have a complex question for decomposition
    When I process it through the LAG engine
    Then a preflight_plan.json should be generated with the decomposition graph
    And the execution_trace.ndjson should contain all LAG steps
    And each step should have run_id and correlation_id
    And memory_pre.json and memory_post.json should be created
    And the LAG chain should be fully traceable through artifacts

  @lag @edge-case @robustness
  Scenario: LAG handling of ambiguous questions
    Given I have an ambiguous question "What is the best solution?"
    When the LAG engine attempts decomposition
    Then it should identify the ambiguity in cognitive load calculation
    And request clarification rather than making assumptions
    And the ambiguity should be flagged in the terminator reasoning
    And no decomposition should proceed without sufficient context
