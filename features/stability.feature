Feature: System Stability and Reproducibility (98.6% Target)
  As a GENESIS orchestrator user
  I want the system to demonstrate 98.6% reproducibility across multiple runs
  So that results are reliable and deterministic for production use

  Background:
    Given the GENESIS orchestrator is configured for maximum stability
    And temperature is set to 0.2 or lower
    And deterministic seed is configured
    And router tie-breaking is set to "id"
    And tool mocking is deterministic
    And embedding caching is enabled

  @stability @reproducibility @critical
  Scenario: 98.6% stability across 5 runs with same input
    Given I have a complex multi-hop test question "What is the GDP per capita of the country that hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics?"
    And I have fixed all randomness sources
    When I process the question 5 times with identical inputs
    Then all 5 runs should produce equivalent plans
    And all 5 runs should produce equivalent routing decisions
    And answer differences should be <= 1.4% Levenshtein distance
    And latency variance should be within Â± 1.4% of median
    And the stability percentage should be >= 98.6%

  @stability @plan @equivalence
  Scenario: Plan graph equivalence verification
    Given I have a question requiring decomposition
    When I generate plans across multiple runs
    Then the plan graphs should be structurally identical
    And step dependencies should match exactly
    And step ordering should be consistent
    And terminator conditions should be equivalent
    And preflight_plan.json should be identical across runs

  @stability @routing @consistency
  Scenario: Route set equality under budget constraints
    Given I have a memory store with consistent content
    And role budgets are fixed across runs
    When I perform context routing multiple times
    Then the selected document sets should be identical
    And importance scores should be consistent
    And budget utilization should match exactly
    And routing decisions should be deterministic

  @stability @seed @determinism
  Scenario: Deterministic behavior with fixed seeds
    Given the system is configured with seed value 42
    And all random components use this seed
    When I run the same query multiple times
    Then model outputs should be identical
    And retrieval rankings should be consistent
    And importance calculations should match
    And no variance should occur in deterministic components

  @stability @temperature @control
  Scenario: Temperature impact on stability
    Given I test with different temperature settings:
      | Temperature | Expected Stability |
      | 0.0         | 100%              |
      | 0.1         | >= 99%            |
      | 0.2         | >= 98.6%          |
      | 0.3         | >= 95%            |
    When I run stability tests at each temperature
    Then the measured stability should meet expectations
    And temperature 0.2 should achieve the 98.6% target
    And higher temperatures should show increased variance

  @stability @artifacts @consistency
  Scenario: Artifact consistency across runs
    Given I process the same input across 5 runs
    When I examine the generated artifacts
    Then execution_trace.ndjson should have consistent structure
    And router_metrics.json should contain identical values
    And memory_pre.json and memory_post.json should match
    And all run_ids should be different but correlation_ids consistent for same inputs
    And timestamps should be the only varying elements

  @stability @latency @variance
  Scenario: Latency variance within acceptable bounds
    Given I have baseline latency measurements for a test question
    When I measure latency across 10 runs
    Then the standard deviation should be <= 1.4% of median
    And outliers should be minimal (<= 1 out of 10 runs)
    And p50 latency should be stable
    And p95 latency should be within acceptable variance

  @stability @answer @diff
  Scenario: Answer difference measurement using Levenshtein distance
    Given I have answers from 5 identical runs
    When I compute pairwise Levenshtein distances
    Then all distances should be <= 1.4% of answer length
    And semantic similarity should be >= 95%
    And key facts should be preserved across all runs
    And only minor variations in phrasing should occur

  @stability @memory @state
  Scenario: Memory state consistency verification
    Given the system starts with empty memory
    And I process a question that adds items to memory
    When I run the same process multiple times
    Then memory_post.json should be identical across runs
    And memory item ordering should be consistent
    And embedding IDs should match (with caching)
    And tag assignments should be deterministic

  @stability @tool @mocking
  Scenario: Tool call determinism with mocking
    Given external tools are mocked for deterministic responses
    And tool call ordering is fixed
    When I execute workflows requiring tool calls
    Then tool call sequences should be identical
    And tool responses should be consistent
    And tool_call_ids should follow predictable patterns
    And no external variability should affect results

  @stability @error @handling
  Scenario: Consistent error handling across runs
    Given I have a test case that triggers a known error condition
    When I run it multiple times
    Then the error should be handled identically
    And error messages should be consistent
    And fallback behavior should be deterministic
    And recovery paths should be the same

  @stability @tie-breaking @determinism
  Scenario: Deterministic tie-breaking in router
    Given I have documents with identical importance scores
    And tie-breaker is configured to use "id"
    When routing selects from tied documents
    Then selection should be consistent across runs
    And tie-breaking rule should be applied correctly
    And no randomness should affect tied selections
    And document ordering should be deterministic

  @stability @metrics @measurement
  Scenario: Stability metrics collection and reporting
    Given I run a stability test with 5 iterations
    When the test completes
    Then I should receive a stability report with:
      | Metric                    | Requirement |
      | Plan equivalence rate     | 100%        |
      | Route consistency rate    | 100%        |
      | Answer similarity rate    | >= 98.6%    |
      | Latency variance          | <= 1.4%     |
      | Overall stability score   | >= 98.6%    |
    And the report should include detailed variance analysis

  @stability @regression @testing
  Scenario: Stability regression detection
    Given I have historical stability baselines
    When I run current stability tests
    Then current stability should not be significantly worse than baseline
    And any degradation should be flagged for investigation
    And regression thresholds should be configurable
    And trend analysis should be provided

  @stability @configuration @validation
  Scenario: Stability configuration validation
    Given I want to verify optimal stability settings
    When I test different configuration combinations
    Then the system should recommend settings for 98.6% target
    And configuration impact should be measured
    And optimal parameters should be documented
    And stability vs performance trade-offs should be reported

  @stability @edge-cases @robustness
  Scenario: Stability under edge case conditions
    Given I have edge case inputs (empty, very long, special characters)
    When I test stability with these inputs
    Then the system should maintain stability requirements
    And edge cases should not break determinism
    And error handling should remain consistent
    And no undefined behavior should occur

  @stability @parallel @execution
  Scenario: Stability with parallel execution
    Given the system supports parallel processing
    When I run multiple instances concurrently
    Then each instance should maintain individual stability
    And cross-instance interference should be minimal
    And shared resources should not affect determinism
    And parallel results should be equivalent to serial results
